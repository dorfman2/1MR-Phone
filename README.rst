An MP3 rotary telephone

-----
Description
-----
This module contains python 3 script to operate an interactive, rotary telephone. It plays back different audio files when different numbers are dialed. It features an OSC client to provide interactivity with audio & video elements on the same network. 

It can be used without untilizing OSC, but be sure to install the dependacy unless you want to comment out all the references
    
This phone was designed and built for a interactive performance called One Mile Radius Project(1MR for short).

Installation
-----

Dependencies;

    * Git
    * gpiozero
    * python-osc
    * python-pip
    * python3
    * python3-pip
    * mpg123

To Install Dependencies & 1MR-Phone
-----
Boot up the RaspberryPi and login. First update your Repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
        
Install Python3, mpg123, git, and python3-pip

.. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo apt-get install git python-pip python3 python3-pip mpg123 python3-gpiozero
        
Install python-osc

.. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo pip install python-osc
        $ sudo pip3 install python-osc
        
Navigate to your root directory (/home/pi) and install 1MR-Phone using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ cd
        $ git clone https://github.com/dorfman2/1MR-Phone.git

Navigate into the folder and make /usr/bin/phone executable:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ cd /home/pi/1MR-Phone
        $ sudo chmod +x /home/pi/1MR-Phone/phone.py

        
Move sp.service to systemd if you want this to run at boot. Navigate to the folder first.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ cd /home/pi/1MR-Phone
        $ sudo cp sp.service /etc/systemd/system/sp.service
        $ sudo systemctl enable sp.service
        
        

       

 

Use
-----

Copy your MP3 Files to /media, rename them to digits you want to be dialed "123.mp3."

I prefer to use FileZilla for this.


You can start and stop the service by using these commands.

.. code-block:: bash
        
        $ sudo systemctl stop sp.service
        $ sudo systemctl start sp.service
        
To disable the service for later debugging

.. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo systemctl disable sp.service
        $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Hardware
-----
List

* Rotary Telephone
* Raspberry Pi w/ Memory card
* 5v Power Supply
* Ethernet Cable

Build
-----
1. Open up your rotary telephone. 
2. Remove the circuit board and bells. Be sure to keep the wires leading to the rotary, as well as the handset and handset switch.
3. Use a meter or some low voltage method to identify the wires connected.

- Dial Circuit - this is active when dialing
- Rotary Circuit - This is active when you release. Count the amount of clicks and it returns the number dialed.
- Reciever or Hook Circuit - The contact that reacts to if the phone is "hung up."

4. Connect these three circuits to ground, and three different GPIO pins. Not all GPIO pins are created equal, and this varies based on your Raspberry Pi model. I used for my Raspberry pi 2(With BCIM numbers)

- Dial = 18 (Hardware Pin 12)
- Ground (Hardware Pin 14)
- Rotary = 23 (Hardware Pin 16)
- Reciever = 24 (Hardware Pin 18)

5. Connect to ethernet
6. connect to Power
